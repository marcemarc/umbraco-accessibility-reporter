# Accessibility Reporter For Umbraco

![Accessibility Reporter logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattbegent/umbraco-accessibility-reporter/main/logos/logo64.png)

## What is it?

Accessibility Reporter for Umbraco is a content app that helps you test the accessibility of your website against common accessibility standards, including the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), Section 508 and best practices, directly in Umbraco.

## Why should I use it?

You want to help make your Umbraco website more accessible by testing it against WCAG success criteria.

## How does it work?

It runs an accessibility audit against the current live version of the page that you are editing and displays a report in a tab called 'Accessibility'. The tests are run in an iframe directly in Umbraco or optionally using an Azure function.

## How do I install it?

You can install Accessibility Reporter using Nuget `https://www.nuget.org/packages/Umbraco.Community.AccessibilityReporter`. Once installed when you build your project the files needed for Accessibility Reporter will be copied into your App_Plugins folder. That's it!

## Options

You can run Accessibility Reporter without adding any configuration options, as it has some sensible defaults. However, you can configure how it runs by adding an `AccessibilityReporter` section to your `appsettings.json` file.

### Available options

- **ApiUrl** - This is the URL of the API that will run the tests. By default the tests are run in an iframe within Umbraco, however if you website is on a different domain to your Umbraco instance to get around iframe security issues, you can host an API on an Azure function by forking `https://github.com/mattbegent/azure-function-accessibility-reporter` and deploying it to Azure.  
- **TestBaseUrl** (optional) - If you run Umbraco in a headless way or Accessibility Reporter is having trouble finding the domain to test against, set this to the base URL of your wesbite. If not set Accessibility Reporter will try to infer this from available information in Umbraco.
- **TestsToRun** (optional) - This sets which axe-core rules should be run. For example, you may want to test your website against `wcag2a` only. A full list of supported tags can be found in the [axe-core documentation](https://www.deque.com/axe/core-documentation/api-documentation/#axe-core-tags). If not set Accessibility Reporter defaults to WCAG A and AA tests. 
- **UserGroups** (optional) - Use this option if you want to restrict which user groups can see Accessibility Reporter. By default users with admin, editor or writer permissions can see it.
- **ExcludedDocTypes** (optional) - Use this option if you want to exclude Accessibility Reporter from showing on certain document types.
- **RunTestsAutomatically** (optional) - By default Accessibility Reporter runs as soon as you open up a content node. If you instead want Accessibility Reporter to run on demand via a button click, set this option to false.

### Example options

    "AccessibilityReporter": {
        "ApiUrl": "https://api.example.com/api/audit",
        "TestBaseUrl": "https://example.com",
        "TestsToRun": [
            "wcag2a", 
            "wcag2aa", 
            "wcag21a", 
            "wcag21aa", 
            "wcag22aa",
            "wcag***"
        ],
        "UserGroups": [
            "admin",
            "editor",
            "writer"
        ],
        "ExcludedDocTypes": [
            "excludedPage"
        ],
        "RunTestsAutomatically": false
    }

### Defaults

All options are completely optional and if you don't set them, they default to the following:

    "AccessibilityReporter": {
        "ApiUrl": "",
        "TestBaseUrl": "",
        "TestsToRun": [
            "wcag2a", 
            "wcag2aa", 
            "wcag21a", 
            "wcag21aa", 
            "wcag22aa",
            "best-practice"
        ],
        "UserGroups": [
            "admin",
            "editor",
            "writer",
            "translator", 
            "sensitiveData"
        ],
        "RunTestsAutomatically": true
    }

## Limitations

The accessibility report runs on the current page URL you are editing.

Automated accessibility testing is no substitute for manual testing and testing using real users. In a [UK government blog article](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2017/02/24/what-we-found-when-we-tested-tools-on-the-worlds-least-accessible-webpage/) they created a test page with 143 accessibility issues on it and the best automated tool only discovered 37% of the issues. However, automated accessibility testing does help to find common issues and technical failures.

## Roadmap

- Support for multisite setups.
- Manual test recommendations.
- Localization - if anyone speaks any languages other than English it would be super to get some help.
